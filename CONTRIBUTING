Contributing to Johanson

  There is really not much to know about johanson for contributing.  If you
  want to send some pull requests by my friend.  Please follow the following
  general rules:

  name external symbols ``jhn_FOO``, name internal (non static) symbols
  ``jhn__FOO``.

    Why?  Because it makes it very clear which symbols are supposed to be
    exported and which ones not.  Do not export stuff that is clearly internal
    or only utility.  We don't want to have an ABI that breaks by accident
    or is unintentionally bloated.

    For statics there is no reason to namespace.

  Be very careful with public structs because of padding.  We do not want
  any, the exception is the ``jhn_alloc_funcs`` which we kinda inherited
  from YAJL where there is no clear way how to get rid of them without
  making the API more annoying.
