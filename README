     -- a simple, iterative JSON library for C for easy embedding


   Johanson is a hard fork of the YAJL2 library by Lloyd Hilaiel.  I needed
   to modify the library in a few ways to acomodate a specific use I had
   which was to embed YAJL into another application and to use some of the
   internals.

   Primarily the difference between Johanson and YAJL:

     - johanson uses ``char *``, YAJL uses ``unsigned char *``.
     - johanson exposes the lexer, YAJL does not.
     - johanson has differently named symbols than YAJL
     - johanson does not provide a version information (yet?)
     - johanson does not have a tree (removed because it did not work
       with the YAJL allocation routines)
     - johanson can be easily compiled without CMake/premake etc.
     - johanson is differently structured internally for easier
       development.  You do not need a specific build tool for it to
       find the headers and the headers were refactored to be fewer.

   Other than that it is MIT licensed like you would expect.

   For building a premake4 file is included, but there is nothing special
   that needs to be defined, just build them as you feel fit.
