     -- a simple, iterative JSON library for C for easy embedding


   Johanson is a hard fork of the YAJL2 library by Lloyd Hilaiel.  I needed
   to modify the library in a few ways to acomodate a specific use I had
   which was to embed YAJL into another application and to use some of the
   internals.

   What does Johanson do for you?

   - customizable allocators (even on a per parser/lexer basis.  Go nuts)
   - streamed lexing and parsing
   - meant for embedding.  Does not polute your namespace, very friendly
     header, no unportable craziness.
   - can be built without any build tool requirements.  Just drop the
     source into your solution and you're good to go.
   - MIT licensed.

   For building a premake4 file is included, but there is nothing special
   that needs to be defined, just build them as you feel fit.

   An example can be found in the example folder.
